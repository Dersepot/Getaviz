**This component is deprecated and will be replaced by generator2.**

The generator takes a famix, dynamic, and/or hismo model as input and generates a software visualization that can be explored using the ui component.

## How do I build and run the generator?
* [Maven](../wiki/Maven) is used as build management system. It is used to build the generator, to run testcases and to run the mwe2 workflows
* All pre-configured Run configurations are accessible via *Run → Run Configurations → Maven Build*
* For a detailed description of the different Maven configurations, click [here](new link)
